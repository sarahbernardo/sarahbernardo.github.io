        <p>Hi, my name is Sarah Bernardo and Iâ€™m a third-year Honors Data Science major 
            with minors in Mathematics and Music Industry. I just finished my first co-op 
            as a Strategic Operations Co-Op at The Routing Company, a Boston-based startup 
            focusing on making public transit more sustainable and convenient. 
            In my free time, I enjoy listening to music, running, playing the guitar, and cooking.
        </p>

            Pictured above is the ginger soup that I am currently waiting to eat. If you click on
            the image, it will change to the lineup poster for Hinterland Music Festival that I just
            bought tickets to. Very exciting!
        </p>
        <p>In the future, I hope to incorporate the following in my site</p>

        <ul>
            <li>personal projects</li>
            <li>past class projects</li>
            <li>my resume</li>
            <li>an about me section</li>
        </ul>
